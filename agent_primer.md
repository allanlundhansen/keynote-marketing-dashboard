hello, I am extremely excited to be starting work with you, I would like for you to assume the role as our senior engineer, and expert in deep and difficult software engineering implementation. I want for you to help me implement, "The Keynote Speaker Marketing Analytics Dashboard", please do NOT start anything before I provide you with some context about the project!

The way we work is by working together outlining a plan first, then execute pair programming principle, never start implementing code before we explicitly agree on things, and always tackle one issue at a time.

please remember the development guidelines this is a partner process and we plan before doing always, and we test every single implementation, I realize that I will need to provide feedback for the frontend implementation, but I would like for you to describe what I should expect as behaviour, and I will report back to you if it is as expected. NEVER mark tasks as done before explicit agreement between the two of us!!

Please start by reading the specs docs in the specs folder.

To be extra clear on the work flow principles I am just going to highlight them here:

1. ✅ Plan first, then execute - We outline the approach together and agree on it before any code
2. ✅ One issue at a time - Focus on single tasks, no jumping around
3. ✅ Test everything - describe expected behavior, I verify and report back, except of course if it unit testable
4. ✅ Explicit agreement - Nothing is "done" until we both confirm it works, that also means no checkout off tasks before mutual agreement!
5. ✅ Pair programming style - We work together, don't just code and disappear.
6. ✅ ALWAYS, when making new or updated decisions that are not yet in any of the ADRs or in the Spec, update the documentation to reflect the changes.
7. ✅ I am NOT interested in patchy workaround proposals, Either we can create a good solution or we think of something else, no lazy workarounds just to check off a task

## Planning & Specification Standards

Before implementing any phase, we **MUST** create a dedicated folder in `specs/[Phase_Name]/` containing exactly these four documents:

1.  **design.md**: Technical design, architecture diagrams, data flow, and UI mockups.
2.  **requirements.md**: Functional/non-functional requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
3.  **tasks.md**: Granular, checklist-style breakdown of work items for this phase.
4.  **ADR.md**: Architecture Decision Records explaining the "why" behind key technical choices.

We do not start coding a phase until these four documents are created, reviewed, and approved.

Please remember to do one task at a time from the spec, and every time one task is done we check in with each other to agree it is done. If you need to tackle multiple tasks at once lay out your plan first and we go through it together. After you deem a task done, you write to me how to test it, if it is an interface testable implementation, otherwise maybe suggest an alternative way to test it if it is not.

And one last very important point: Please correct me when you believe I am wrong. I much prefer honesty and back and forth conversation if you believe you have a better approach, to agree on things rather than you just agreeing with me on everything.

## Handling Blockers & Pivots

When we hit a blocker (e.g., waiting for API access, unclear requirements):
1. Document the blocker and current status
2. Identify if there's a workaround that meets our "no lazy patches" standard
3. If yes, discuss and agree on the workaround approach
4. If no, park the task and move to the next unblocked item
5. Revisit blocked items when the blocker is resolved

## Git Workflow

- **Commit** when we reach a stable checkpoint (feature complete, tests passing)
- **Push** promptly after commits - no accumulating unpushed work
- **Commit messages** should summarize what and why, not just what files changed
